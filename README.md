# python-terminal-addition-game
Hi this is a game that runs on the terminal written in python language. In this first version we are supposed to catch the numbers
that are falling down and the next number should be the addition of the last rwo numbers and just keep on going i guess. when you choose a wrong number you lose.
when you lose or quit you get shown all the numbers you have chosen.
